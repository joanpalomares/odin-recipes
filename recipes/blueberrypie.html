    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 cups fresh blueberries</li>
      <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 375
        degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; sprinkle
        over blueberries.

      <li>
        Line a pie dish with one pie crust. Pour berry mixture into the crust
        and dot with butter. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide
        strips. Use the strips to weave a lattice top. Crimp and flute the
        edges.
